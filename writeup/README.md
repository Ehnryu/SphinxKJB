### Introduction
The goal of this jailbreak was to gain root on the system with the least amount of effort required. As such, it takes advantage of Webkit crash PoC code that already exists. The jailbreak was developed in around 100 hours during August and September of 2015. It was then submitted to Amazon Security and finally released in February 2016 after patch with a fix was released.

### History
There have been many exploits for kindle, but not really any named jailbreaks. So far the name just goes with the developer. Sphinx aims to be modern and therefore uses a name. The aim of sphinx is to be modern, fast and capable. Most other kindle jailbreaks are not user friendly or auto mated which sphinx aims to do.

### The aim
The point of it is to gain root privilages by exploiting a bug in the OS, at least this was the point until the hotifx extension. The hotfix extension allowed the jailbreak to remain after a OS update, making it untethered. This meant that we could restore to a jailbreakable firmware and then go back to the latest version.

Now because of that new exploit aren't being developed
